1) Please review services provided by any one of the public cloud providers (e.g. Azure, Google, AWS etc.) and list one example per each of the cloud delivery models covered in
lecture 
1. Elaborate on your favorite cloud delivery model and why
I’ll review services provided by Amazon Web Services AWS:
AWS:
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
* AWS EC2 – Provides scalable infrastructure for companies who want to host cloudbased applications. EC2 users do not own physical servers. AWS provides virtual servers.
Users only pay for the usage of the servers, saving them the cost (and associated ongoing
maintenance) of investing in physical hardware.
* AWS offers over 100 cloud computing services such as EC2, RDS, S3. Most of these services can be used as IaaS and most companies who use AWS will pick and choose the
services they need.
* However, managing these services can become difficult and time consuming for the users.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* AWS Elastic beanstalk - When managing the IaaS becomes difficult the AWS elastic beanstalk comes in: it works as another layer on top of the infrastructure services and
automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling and application health monitoring. Software as a Service (SaaS)
* SaaS products are deployed and hosted by AWS.
* The popular ones are –
o Trello – B2B SaaS product – This is hosted on AWS and enables users to organize and prioritize their projects
o Databricks – Used for big data analytics 

Popular AWS services:
Compute:
1) AWS EC2 Iaas - web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
2) AWS lambda - AWS Lambda lets to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
3) AWS Elastic Beanstalk - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and
scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS
Containers:
1) Amazon Elastic Container Registry: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web
service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
2) Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS): makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale
containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS.
3) AWS Fargate: is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters.
Storage:
1) Amazon S3 – Data lake
2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)- provides block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EBS volumes are network-attached and persist independently from the life of an instance.
3) AWS Snowball - petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS services

Security:
1) AWS Key Management Service: AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage encryption keys.
2) AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources

Network:
1) Amazon CloudFront: Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low
latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.
2) Amazon Route 53: Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

Database:
1) Relational Database Service (RDS): Relational databases in clould
2) Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL database in clould

Messaging and Analytics:
1) Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS): Queuing service.
2) Simple Notification Service (SNS): Push notification service

Cloud Delivery Model:
Let’s review the applications of cloud delivery model in the IT industry. The cloud delivery
model depends on many factors such as the scale of organization, infrastructure present etc.
Depending on the organization type and surrounding factors considered on can chose a suitable
delivery model as follows:
IaaS:
• Is best for organizations migrating their existing infrastructure to the cloud.
• Large enterprises with a lot of IT staff
PaaS:
• Developers creating new cloud-native applications
• Large organizations with custom in-house applications.
SaaS:
• Small organizations with minimal IT staff
• Replacing a particular type of business software

I personally prefer SaaS products as it’s easily customizable and can be easily built and deployed
in the Cloud. But choosing the right delivery model should be based on the strengths and
weaknesses and based on a particular situation some pointers are shown above.

2) Provide a summary of cloud computing evolution and provide your point of view or
understanding on why it has become such a relevant topic in today’s IT industry? ( 20
Points)
Four technologies played an important role in the evolution of Cloud computing.
These technologies are –
1) Distributed Systems – As the need for greater computing speed was required the use of single
computer to depend on everything was not sufficient. So, distributed systems started to gain
popularity in the 1950. As distributed systems had the ability to share the resources effectively
and efficiently. The main problem was that it was to be present in the same geographical
location. To solve this problem distributed computing led to three more types of computing they
were mainframe, cluster and grid computing
• Mainframe – First came to existence in 1951 are highly powerful and reliable machines
These systems have no downtime and high fault tolerance systems. These systems are
even used today for online transactions. But these systems are expensive to reduce the
cost cluster computing came as an alternative to mainframe.
• Cluster Computing – This technology gained popularity in 1980 as an alternative to
mainframe. In this the machine were connected to each other to form cluster with high
bandwidth. To increase the speed of computing new nodes could be added to the cluster.
This technique solved the problem of cost but there were geographical restrictions.
• In Grid computing the systems are placed in geographically different locations which was
highly efficient form of distributed computing.
2) Virtualization: It was introduced nearly 40 years back [1]. It refers to creating a virtual layer
over the hardware which allows the user to run multiple instances simultaneously on the
hardware. The major players were Amazon EC2, VMware, Vcloud etc.
3) Web 2.0: It is an interface through which cloud computing services interact with the clients.
Ex: Twiiter, facebook etc.
4) Utility Computing: Pay per use services such as storage, infrastructure etc.
Because of the evolution of cloud computing over the past 40 years, there are several benefits for
the IT industry few of the major ones are:
1) Flexibility –
• Scalability: cloud infrastructure scales on demand to support fluctuating loads. This
• Storage Options: Public, private, hybrid depending on security needs.
• Control Choices: IT industry can determine the level of control over their service
based on SaaS, PaaS, IaaS.
• Virtual Private cloud
2) Efficiency –
• Accessibility – Data is accessible from virtually any internet connected device.
• Speed to the Market – Applications can be developed and deployed to the market
quickly.
• Data Security -cloud provides backups so hardware failures do not result in Market
loss.
• Savings on equipment – Provides savings on equipment live servers.
• Pay for the resources as the IT industry use.
3) Strategic Value –
• Most of the cloud providers provide strategic updates with their infrastructure
with the most up to date technology.
• Competitive edge – The IT industry can move more rapidly by using the cloud
infrastructure.
